// Question24: Write a JavaScript function to apply Bubble Sort algorithm.
//             Note: According to wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order".
//             Sample array: [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213]
//             Expected output: [3223, 546, 455, 345, 234, 213, 122, 98, 84, 64, 23, 12, 9, 4, 1]

// Solution: Bubble Sort in descending order
const bubble = function (arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
      }
    }
  }
};

// Test case
const arr1 = [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213];
bubble(arr1);
console.log("after sorting: ", arr1);
